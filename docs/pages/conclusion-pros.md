#### Conclusion: having less functions means

0. Less code to write, when you do a feature the first time
0. Less code to refactor, when you update a feature
0. Less code to learn, when you join the team
0. Less code to keep in the head, when you try to understand the problem

Thus, reactive programming simply saves time
